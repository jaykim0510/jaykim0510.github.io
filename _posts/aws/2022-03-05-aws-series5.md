# S3란 무엇인가

object storage service from Amazon that provides industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance  

simple management capabilities that allow you to organize your data and fine-tune access controls to match your specific commercial, organizational, and compliance needs.  

# S3의 이점

- Performance, scalability, availability, and durability that are unrivalled in the industry
- Many cost-effective storage classes are available
- Security, compliance, and auditing capabilities that are unrivalled
- Manage data and access permissions with ease
- Query-in-place and on-demand processing
- The most widely used cloud storage service


# S3의 구성요소

## Object

- Objects are fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3
- It consists of its data as well as its metadata
- S3 cannot access the content or data inside the object
- It can only read the metadata ssociated with the object
- It allocates a unique version ID for the object when some data is added to the bucket

## Bucket

- Buckets are the containers where objects are stored and then uploaded to Amazon S3
- There will never be an object without a Bucket
- There is no "Windows Explorer" like hierarchy -> just prefix
- One can create Buckets in any region of the World which is close to you -> shoud be globally unique name

# S3의 동작원리

When files are uploaded to the Bucket, the user will specify the type of S3 storage class to be used for those specific objects  

- S3 Standard
  - Latency is supposed to be low
  - Example: Frequently accessed data
- S3 Standard for Infrequent Data Access
  - Where the data is long lived and is not frequently accessed.
  - Example: Emplyee's progress report will not be needed daily
- Amazone Glacier
  - Where data can be archived, and high performance is not required
  - Example: Employee's old record (profile)
- One Zone-IA Storage Class
  - Where data is infrequently accessed and stored in a particular region
  - Example: Employee's performance report is not accessed daily but is stored in a single region
- Amazon S3 Standard Reduced Redundancy Storage
  - Where the data is noncritical and reproduced quickly
  - Example: External data stored which are not important and can be replaced falls under this category

# S3 특징

## Lifecycle Management

- S3 can be configured to move a certain data between various storage classes on a defined schedule
- Two types of action: Transition and Expiration

```
[Management Tab] -> [Lifecycle rules: Create lifecycle rule]
```

## Bucket Policy

- It is an IAM policy which lets you allow and deny permission to your S3 resources
- With this, you also define security parameters for more than one file in the desired bucket

```
First of all, Unblock all public access

[Permission Tab] -> [Bucket policy: Edit] -> [Policy generator] -> Copy policy JSON document -> Paste
```

## Data Encryption

- It intends to protect the data when it is in action or at rest
- Two ways of encryption: Client-Side Encryption and Server-Side Encryption

## Versioning

- It is utilized to preserve and restore early versions of every object stored in your S3 bucket
- Unintentional alteration to a file can be easily regained with versioning
- 파일에 수정이 일어나면 수정 전 내용이 버저닝 된다
```
[Properties Tab] -> [Bucket Versioning: Edit] -> [Bucket Versioning: Enable] -> [Save changes] -> Being tracked by version Number -> You can check the versions of file by clicking [Versions Tab of any file]
```

## Cross-Region Replication

- Cross-Region Replication provides automatic copying of every object uploaded to your buckets(source bucket and destination bucket) in different AWS region

```
First of all, Make another bucket to replicate objects

From Source Bucket -> [Management Tab] -> [Replication rules: Create replication rule]
```

## Transfer Acceleration

- It allows easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between your client and S3 bucket
- It takes advantages of the edge location around the world provided by the Amazon CloudFront
- It works via carrying the data over an optimized network bridge that runs between your clients'AWS Edge location and your S3 bucket

```
[Properties Tab] -> [Transfer acceleration: Edit] -> [Enable]
```
