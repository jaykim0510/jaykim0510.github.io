<p>If youâ€™re trying to point your domain name to your web hosting, youâ€™ve probably come across the term nameserver. So, what is a nameserver?</p>

<p>Nameservers help connect URLs with the IP address of web servers. Nameservers are an important part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which many people call the â€œphone book of the Internetâ€.</p>

<p><strong>What Is a Nameserver? Explained in More Detail</strong></p>

<p>When a user enters a URL in their browser, like â€œkinsta.com, there needs to be some way to connect that URL with the underlying web server that powers the website at that domain name.</p>

<p>Think how difficult it would be if you had to enter the actual IP address of a web server every time you wanted to visit a website. You wouldnâ€™t be able to remember whether it was 159.89.229.118 or 159.89.229.119 â€” it would be a mess!</p>

<p>Nameservers play an important role in connecting a URL with a server IP address in a much more human-friendly way.</p>

<p>Nameservers look like any other domain name. When you look at a websiteâ€™s nameservers, youâ€™ll typically see a minimum of two nameservers (though you can use more). Hereâ€™s an example of what they look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ns-380.awsdns-47.com</li>
  <li>Ns-1076.awsdns-06.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Only instead of serving up a website, those nameservers help direct traffic.</p>

<p>To illustrate the role that nameservers play in directing traffic on the Internet, letâ€™s look at a real example.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say you want to visit the Kinsta homepage. On the surface, this action is simple: you type â€œkinsta.comâ€ into your browserâ€™s address bar and you see the Kinsta homepage. Easy, right?</p>

<p>But behind-the-scenes, the high-level process actually goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You type â€œkinsta.comâ€ into the address bar and hit enter</li>
  <li>Your browser sends a request to that domainâ€™s nameservers</li>
  <li>The nameservers respond back with the IP address of the websiteâ€™s server</li>
  <li>Your browser requests the website content from that IP address</li>
  <li>Your browser retrieves the content and renders it in your browser</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to visit a website you must first access a Domain Name Server. If thereâ€™s an issue with In the the decentralized naming systems responsible for turning hostnames into IP addresses, you might experience a message such as â€œDNS server not respondingâ€.</p>

<p>Nameservers vs DNS Records<br />
In the example above, we left out one point for simplicity:</p>

<p>DNS records are what contain the actual information that other browsers or services need to interact with, like your serverâ€™s IP address.</p>

<p>Nameservers, on the other hand, help store and organize those individual DNS records.</p>

<p>Earlier, we referred to DNS as the phone book of the Internet. But a more specific analogy would be that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nameservers are the physical phone book itself.</li>
  <li>DNS records are the individual entries in the phone book.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wanted to find someoneâ€™s phone number (back when phone books existed!), youâ€™d first grab the phone book itself. Then, youâ€™d open the phone book and go through the entries to find the specific information that you need.</p>

<p>Armed with that knowledge, letâ€™s look at a fuller sequence of what happens when you visit a website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You type â€œkinsta.comâ€ into the address bar and hit enter</li>
  <li>Your browser uses DNS to retrieve the domainâ€™s nameservers</li>
  <li>Your browser asks for the A record that contains the IP address of the web server (a specific DNS record)</li>
  <li>The nameservers provide the IP address from the A record</li>
  <li>Your browser requests the website content from that IP address</li>
  <li>Your browser retrieves the content and renders it in your browser</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Use Nameservers in the Real World</strong><br />
In the real world, youâ€™ll use nameservers and DNS records primarily to point your domain name towards your hosting.</p>

<p>You also might use the DNS records supplied by your nameservers in other ways, like setting up your email account with MX records or verifying your domain name with Google Search Console.</p>

<p>Where Are Your Domainâ€™s Nameservers Located?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is that â€œit dependsâ€.</p>

<p>When you register your domain name through a domain registrar, your domain is usually pointed towards your domain registrarâ€™s nameservers at first. Your domain registrar is also where you can edit your domainâ€™s nameservers.</p>

<p>If you wanted to, you could leave your nameservers at your domain registrar and just edit the DNS records to point your domain name towards your web hosting.</p>

<p>However, many web hosts recommend that you change your domainâ€™s nameservers to nameservers provided by the host. For example, here at Kinsta, we provide premium nameservers powered by Amazon Route 53 that you can use (though you donâ€™t have to):</p>

<p>To change your nameservers, youâ€™ll need to use the interface at the domain registrar where you purchased your domain name.</p>

<p>For example, hereâ€™s what it looks like to change the nameservers at a domain registered through Google Domains.</p>

<p>You can see that the domain is originally configured to use the Google Domains nameservers:</p>

  <li><strong>A record</strong>s: Used to point a domain or a subdomain at an IPv4 address. This is the rule used to point a domain like example.com to the web server where the example.com website lives. (Note: If a web server uses and IPv6 address rather than an IPv4 address, then an AAAA record is used rather than an A record).</li>
  <li><strong>CNAME records</strong>: Used to associate a subdomain to the primary or canonical domain. This type of rule is commonly used to associate a www subdomain with the primary domain, such as www.example.com with example.com.</li>
  <li><strong>MX records</strong>: Used to associate a domain with an email service. This is the type of rule used if you want mail for example.com to be delivered to a specific email service such as Gmail.</li>
  <li><strong>TXT records</strong>: Used to associate any arbitrary text to a domain. Most commonly, TXT records are used to associate SPF records with a domain to improve email deliverability and protect against spammers misusing the domain name when sending out spam.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Note: 
Often DNS lookup information will be cached either locally inside the querying computer or
remotely in the DNS infrastructure. There are typically 8 steps in a DNS lookup. 
When DNS information is cached, 
steps are skipped from the DNS lookup process which makes it quicker. 
The example below outlines all 8 steps when nothing is cached.  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The 8 steps in a DNS lookup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user types â€˜example.comâ€™ into a web browser and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a DNS recursive resolver.</li>
  <li>The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).</li>
  <li>The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward the .com TLD.</li>
  <li>The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.</li>
  <li>The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domainâ€™s nameserver, example.com.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domainâ€™s nameserver.</li>
  <li>The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for example.com, the browser is able to make the request for the web page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The browser makes a HTTP request to the IP address.</li>
  <li>The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the browser (step 10).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="resolution">Resolution</h1>

<p>Resolution is the process of asking for the resource records of a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) and receiving back an answer. Every time that your computer does not have an IP address cached for a required FQDN, a resolution takes place. In this post, I discuss the main components involved in DNS resolution and explain the two main methods in which resolution is performed.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>There are five main components that play a role in DNS resolution.</p>

<p>The first component is the client. This is the host that is asking the question, â€œWhere is www.netflix.com on the internet?â€</p>

<p>The second component is the DNS resolver. Typically provided by your ISP, this serves as the first component that the client reaches out to if the answer to the DNS query is not cached by the client. Its role is to query the other components to find the answer to the original question. The way it does this depends on the type of DNS resolution being performed.</p>

<p>Clients can configure their settings to use a DNS resolver not provided by their ISP. Google, Cloudflare, Verisign, and Cisco are just a handful of companies that offer free-alternative DNS resolvers. Be aware of which resolver you choose though! Every site you visit will likely send a DNS query which is handled by your chosen DNS resolver. This gives that resolver an ability to see what you request and may sell this data to advertisers. Always read the policies of DNS resolvers that you are considering to use.</p>

<p>The third component is the DNS Root Zone, which is questioned if the DNS resolver does not have the answer in cache. Its role is to return the nameservers for the requested TLD. There are 13 root servers in the world operated by 12 organizations. These servers are anycasted and I go into more detail about them in my DNS Architecture post.</p>

<p>The fourth component is the TLDâ€™s Nameservers. Its role is to return the authoritative nameservers of the requested second-level domain.</p>

<p>Finally, the fifth component is the Authoritative Nameservers. These servers are the responsibility of the registrant to provide, and their role is to return the resource record for the requested third-level domain (or apex domain).</p>

<h2 id="iterative-resolution">Iterative Resolution</h2>
<p>There are two types of resolution, the first is iterative. In an iterative resolution, it is the responsibility of the DNS resolver to keep querying nameservers until it gets an answer.</p>

<p>A flowchart describing iterative resolution.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s go through each step in more detail.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The client sends an iterative DNS query for www.blakes.site..</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver receives this query. If it doesnâ€™t have an answer for this query already cached, it will continue by asking a root server where the nameservers for .site are. If it is cached, the answer will be returned here and the process will terminate. Sidenote: The DNS resolver could also store cache entries for the .site TLD nameservers and the blakes.site authoritative nameservers and skip the appropriate steps.</li>
  <li>The root server returns the IP addresses for the .site nameservers. It also can cache the .site nameservers for future usage.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver now has to ask the .site TLD nameservers for the IP addresses of the blakes.site authoritative nameservers. It also can cache the .site nameservers for future usage.</li>
  <li>The .site TLD nameservers return the IP addresses for the blakes.site authoritative nameservers. The DNS resolver can cache the blakes.site authoritative nameservers for future usage.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver asks the blakes.site authoritative nameservers for the resource records for the entry www.</li>
  <li>The blakes.site authoritative nameservers return the resource records for the entry www.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver caches the response and returns it back to the client.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recursive-resolution">Recursive Resolution</h2>
<p>The alternative to iterative resolution is recursive resolution. Instead of an address to the next nameserver being sent back to the DNS resolver to then query, the nameserver makes the request itself and returns the result all the way back up to the DNS resolver.</p>

<p>A flowchart describing recursive resolution.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s also go through this resolution step-by-step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The client sends a recursive DNS query for www.blakes.site.. Nothing new.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver receives this query. If it doesnâ€™t have an answer for this query already cached, it will continue by asking a root server for the answer to www.blakes.site.. If it is cached, the answer will be returned here and the process will terminate.</li>
  <li>If the root server did not have an answer cached, then it asks the next component that could have an answer: the TLD nameservers. The root servers can also cache the TLD nameservers for the requested domain for future use.</li>
  <li>If the TLD nameservers did not have an answer cached, then it asks the next component that could have an answer: the authoritative nameservers. The TLD nameservers can also cache the authoritative nameservers for the requested domain for future use.</li>
  <li>The authoritative nameservers find an answer for www.blakes.site. and pass the answer up back to the TLD nameservers.</li>
  <li>The TLD nameservers pass the answer back up to the root server.</li>
  <li>The root server passes the answer back to the DNS resolver.</li>
  <li>The DNS resolver caches and passes the answer back to the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is caching at each component, so it is possible that only a partial resolution has to take place for a query. If the requested FQDN is popular and the DNS resolver is being used by a lot of people, then it is completely possible that the root servers are never contacted.</p>

<h2 id="recursive-resolution-proscons">Recursive Resolution: Pros/Cons</h2>
<p>In general, recursive resolution tends to be faster than its iterative counterpart due to caching of final answers. However, this type of resolution creates security flaws including cache poisoning and DNS amplification attacks.</p>

<h2 id="responsibility-recursive-vs-iterative">Responsibility: Recursive vs Iterative</h2>
<p>In recursive resolution, the burden of having to contact nameservers belongs to the server. On the flip side, for iterative resolution, the burden of contacting nameservers belongs to the client.</p>

<h1 id="domain-name-hierarchy">Domain Name Hierarchy</h1>

<p><img src="/images/fqdn.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Alternatively referred to as a namespace, a domain namespace is a name service provided by the Internet for Transmission Control Protocol networks/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). DNS is broken up into domains, a logical organization of computers that exist in a larger network. Below is an example of the hierarchy of domain naming on the Internet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/domain_name_hierarchy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the example above, all websites are broken into regional sections based on the TLD (top-level domain). With http://support.computerhope.com, it has a â€œ.comâ€ TLD, â€œcomputerhopeâ€ as its second level domain (local to the .com TLD), and â€œsupportâ€ as its subdomain, which is determined by its server.</p>
