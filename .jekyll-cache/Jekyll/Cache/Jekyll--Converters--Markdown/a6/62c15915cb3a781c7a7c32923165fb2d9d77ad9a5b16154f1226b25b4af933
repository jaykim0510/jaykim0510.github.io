<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The front-end is the code that is executed on the client side. This code (typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) runs in the user’s browser and creates the user interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The back-end also includes the database, which will persistently store all of the data for the application.</li>
  <li>The back-end is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:
    <ul>
      <li>The server. This is the computer that receives requests.</li>
      <li>The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.</li>
      <li>The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principles for Request-Response Cycle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The server typically cannot initiate responses without requests!</li>
  <li>Every request needs a response, even if it’s just a 404 status code indicating that the content was not found. Otherwise your client will be left hanging (indefinitely waiting).</li>
  <li>The server should not send more than one response per request. This will throw errors in your code.</li>
</ul>
