<p>Concurrent and parallel are effectively the same principle as you correctly surmise, both are related to tasks being executed simultaneously although I would say that parallel tasks should be truly multitasking, executed â€œat the same timeâ€ whereas concurrent could mean that the tasks are sharing the execution thread while still appearing to be executing in parallel.</p>

<p>Asynchronous methods arenâ€™t directly related to the previous two concepts, asynchrony is used to present the impression of concurrent or parallel tasking but effectively an asynchronous method call is normally used for a process that needs to do work away from the current application and we donâ€™t want to wait and block our application awaiting the response.</p>

<p>For example, getting data from a database could take time but we donâ€™t want to block our UI waiting for the data. The async call takes a call-back reference and returns execution back to your code as soon as the request has been placed with the remote system. Your UI can continue to respond to the user while the remote system does whatever processing is required, once it returns the data to your call-back method then that method can update the UI (or handoff that update) as appropriate.</p>

<p>Concurrency means executing multiple tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously. When you have to perform more than one task but you have a single resource then we go for concurrency. In a single-core environment, concurrency is achieved by context switching.</p>

<p>Parallelism is like performing more than one task simultaneously like you can sing and bath together. Now you are doing the tasks in parallel.</p>

<p>The term asynchronous is related to thread execution. In an asynchronous model, when one task gets executed, you can switch to a different task without waiting for the previous task to get completed.</p>

<p>Asynchronous programming helps us to achieve concurrency. Asynchronous programming in a multi-threaded environment is a way to achieve parallelism.</p>

<h1 id="there-are-several-scenarios-in-which-concurrency-can-occur">There are several scenarios in which concurrency can occur:</h1>

<p>Asynchronyâ€” This means that your program performs non-blocking operations. For example, it can initiate a request for a remote resource via HTTP and then go on to do some other task while it waits for the response to be received. Itâ€™s a bit like when you send an email and then go on with your life without waiting for a response.</p>

<p>Parallelismâ€” This means that your program leverages the hardware of multi-core machines to execute tasks at the same time by breaking up work into tasks, each of which is executed on a separate core. Itâ€™s a bit like singing in the shower: youâ€™re actually doing two things at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>Multithreadingâ€” This is a software implementation allowing different threads to be executed concurrently. A multithreaded program appears to be doing several things at the same time even when itâ€™s running on a single-core machine. This is a bit like chatting with different people through various IM windows; although youâ€™re actually switching back and forth, the net result is that youâ€™re having multiple conversations at the same time.</p>
