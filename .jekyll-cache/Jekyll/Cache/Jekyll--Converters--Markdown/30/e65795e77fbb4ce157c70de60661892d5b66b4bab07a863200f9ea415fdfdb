<h1 id="dfs">DFS</h1>

<p>Given a graph, how can we find all of its vertices, and how can we find all paths between two vertices?</p>

<p>The depth-first search algorithm is ideal in solving these kinds of problems because it can explore all paths from the start vertex to all other vertices</p>

<p>In Graph theory, the depth-first search algorithm (abbreviated as DFS) is mainly used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traverse all vertices in a â€œgraphâ€</li>
  <li>Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a â€œgraphâ€.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bfs">BFS</h1>

<p>the â€œbreadth-first searchâ€ algorithm can traverse all vertices of a â€œgraphâ€ and traverse all paths between two vertices. However, the most advantageous use case of â€œbreadth-first searchâ€ is to efficiently find the shortest path between two vertices in a â€œgraphâ€ where all edges have equal and positive weights.</p>

<p>Although the â€œdepth-first searchâ€ algorithm can find the shortest path between two vertices in a â€œgraphâ€ with equal and positive weights, it must traverse all paths between two vertices before finding the shortest one. The â€œbreadth-first searchâ€ algorithm, in most cases, can find the shortest path without traversing all paths. This is because when using â€œbreadth-first searchâ€, as soon as a path between the source vertex and target vertex is found, it is guaranteed to be the shortest path between the two nodes.</p>

<p>In Graph theory, the primary use cases of the â€œbreadth-first searchâ€ (â€œBFSâ€) algorithm are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traversing all vertices in the â€œgraphâ€</li>
  <li>Finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph where all edges have equal and positive weights.</li>
</ul>
