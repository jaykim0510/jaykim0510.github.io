(리스트로 형변환 해야한다.)2. 문자열 데이터 만들기문자열 데이터를 생성하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다.  ‘원하는 문자열’  “원하는 문자열”  ’&#39;’원하는 문자열’’’  ”&quot;”원하는 문자열”””&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &#39;Hello world&#39;&#39;Hello world&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = &quot;Hello world&quot;&#39;Hello world&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; c = &#39;&#39;&#39;Hello world&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Hello world&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello world&quot;&quot;&quot;&#39;Hello world&#39;어떤 따옴표로 묶어도 저장된 값이 모두 같습니다. 그렇다고 해서 아무런 의미가 없지는 않습니다.예를 들어 세 번째와 네 번째의 ‘’’ ‘’’, “”” “&quot;”은 여러줄에 걸쳐있는 문자열을 하나로 담을 수 있습니다.(‘’, ““으로 작성하면 오류가 난다)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &#39;&#39;&#39;Hello world!Nice to meet youI wish you to be happy!&#39;&#39;&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(a)Hello world!Nice to meet youI wish you to be happy!‘와 “ 가 굳이 존재하는 이유는 문자열 안에 ‘ 또는 “이 포함된 경우가 있기 때문입니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &quot;I&#39;d like to eat something&quot;# a = &#39;I&#39;d like to eat something&#39; 으로 하면 &#39;I&#39; 까지만 문자열로 인식합니다&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &#39;He said &quot;I love you&quot;&#39;만약 문자열에 ‘와 “가 둘다 사용된다면 어떻게 해야할까요? (ex. He said “I’d like to eat something”)이 때는 이스케이프 문자를 사용해야 합니다. 즉 ‘‘안에 ‘가 들어가는 경우에는 역슬래쉬(백스페이스 밑에 있음)를 앞에 적어줍니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &#39;He said &quot;I\&#39;d like to eat something&quot;&#39;3. 인덱싱, 슬라이싱이번에는 위에서 만들어진 문자열 데이터를 가지고 원하는 부분만 가져올 수 있도록 해주는 인덱싱, 슬라이싱에 대해 알아보겠습니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &quot;Hello world&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;인덱싱&quot;&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[0]H&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[2]l&quot;&quot;&quot;슬라이싱&quot;&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a[0:5] # 0에서 부터 5앞까지 -&amp;gt;

a = &#39;banana&#39;, b = &#39;apple&#39;, c = &#39;lemon&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(&#39;I like {}, {} and {}&#39;.format(a, b, c))&#39;I like banana, apple and lemon&#39;        f-string 포맷    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(f&#39;I like {a}, {b} and {c}&#39;)        🔔 자릿수를 지정하는 방법     for i in range(1, 100):     for j in range(1, 100):         print(f&#39;{i} * {j} = {i*j}&#39;)        이렇게 하면 99*99단 표를 만들 수 있지만 자릿수가 서로 달라 보기 안좋아진다. 이럴때 자릿수를 지정하게 되면 훨씬 깔끔한 출력문을 얻을 수 있다.     print(f&#39;{i:2} * {j:2} = {i*j:4}&#39;) 99 *   9 =   891 99 *  10 =   990 99 *  11 =  1089      5. 문자열 메소드문자열 데이터는 프로그래밍을 하다보면 정말 자주 만나게 되는 자료형 중에 하나입니다.그렇기 때문에 문자열 객체의 메소드를 잘 활용할 줄 아는 것이 굉장히 중요합니다.먼저 어떤 메소드가 있는지 확인해 보겠습니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = &quot;Hello world&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dir(a)[&#39;__add__&#39;, &#39;__class__&#39;, &#39;__contains__&#39;, &#39;__delattr__&#39;, &#39;__dir__&#39;, &#39;__doc__&#39;, &#39;__eq__&#39;, &#39;__format__&#39;, &#39;__ge__&#39;, &#39;__getattribute__&#39;, &#39;__getitem__&#39;, &#39;__getnewargs__&#39;, &#39;__gt__&#39;, &#39;__hash__&#39;, &#39;__init__&#39;, &#39;__init_subclass__&#39;, &#39;__iter__&#39;, &#39;__le__&#39;, &#39;__len__&#39;, &#39;__lt__&#39;, &#39;__mod__&#39;, &#39;__mul__&#39;, &#39;__ne__&#39;, &#39;__new__&#39;, &#39;__reduce__&#39;, &#39;__reduce_ex__&#39;, &#39;__repr__&#39;, &#39;__rmod__&#39;, &#39;__rmul__&#39;, &#39;__setattr__&#39;, &#39;__sizeof__&#39;, &#39;__str__&#39;, &#39;__subclasshook__&#39;, &#39;capitalize&#39;, &#39;casefold&#39;, &#39;center&#39;, &#39;count&#39;, &#39;encode&#39;, &#39;endswith&#39;, &#39;expandtabs&#39;, &#39;find&#39;, &#39;format&#39;, &#39;format_map&#39;, &#39;index&#39;, &#39;isalnum&#39;, &#39;isalpha&#39;, &#39;isascii&#39;, &#39;isdecimal&#39;, &#39;isdigit&#39;, &#39;isidentifier&#39;, &#39;islower&#39;, &#39;isnumeric&#39;, &#39;isprintable&#39;, &#39;isspace&#39;, &#39;istitle&#39;, &#39;isupper&#39;, &#39;join&#39;, &#39;ljust&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, &#39;lstrip&#39;, &#39;maketrans&#39;, &#39;partition&#39;, &#39;replace&#39;, &#39;rfind&#39;, &#39;rindex&#39;, &#39;rjust&#39;, &#39;rpartition&#39;, &#39;rsplit&#39;, &#39;rstrip&#39;, &#39;split&#39;, &#39;splitlines&#39;, &#39;startswith&#39;, &#39;strip&#39;, &#39;swapcase&#39;, &#39;title&#39;, &#39;translate&#39;, &#39;upper&#39;, &#39;zfill&#39;]여기 있는 메소드들을 반드시 머릿속에 모두 외우고 있을 필요는 없습니다. 그렇게 하기도 힘들구요. 왜냐하면 저희가 문자열 데이터만 사용하는 것도 아니고 여러 형태의 객체가 갖는 메소드를 생각해보면 그 수가 엄청나니까요.실제로 코딩을 하실 때는 기억이 안나면 그 때마다 dir() 함수를 사용해 어떤게 있는지 살펴보면 됩니다. 그러다 익숙해지면 머릿속에 저장되겠지요.5-1 .split()인자(여기서는 쉼표)를 기준으로 나누어 리스트에 저장하여 리턴합니다&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

(C++과 비교해 약 10배 정도 느리다고 합니다)2. 파이썬의 특별한 점      느린 실행 속도를 보완하고자 파이썬에서는 1~256의 값을 메모리에 static하게 저장합니다. 따라서 1~256 사이의 값을 어떤 변수에 할당할 경우, 새로운 메모리를 할당하지 않고 기존에 저장된 값의 주소를 변수가 가리키도록 합니다.    a = 1b = 1c = 4a == b # true (값을 비교한다)a is b # true (주소를 비교한다)b = b + 3b == c # true (값을 비교한다)b is c # true (주소를 비교한다)-------------------------------a = 260b = 260a == b # turea is b # false (값이 같더라도 256이 넘는 숫자에 대해서는 새로운 메모리가 할당된다)------------------------------id(a) = 2592314943888id(b) = 2592314943824            파이썬2에서는 int의 크기는 CPU에 따라 32비트나 64비트로 제한되었습니다. long은 64비트까지 허용하는 정수형 데이터 타입이었습니다. 그러나 파이썬 3에서는 long이 사라지고, int가 arbitrary precision을 지원하여 오버플로우가 생기지 않습니다.🔔 arbitrary-precision은 사용할 수 있는 메모리양이 정해져 있는 기존의 fixed-precision과 달리, 현재 남아있는 만큼의 가용 메모리를 모두 수 표현에 끌어다 쓸 수 있는 형태를 이야기하는 것 같다. 예를 들어 특정 값을 나타내는데 4바이트가 부족하다면 5바이트, 더 부족하면 6바이트까지 사용할 수 있게 유동적으로 운용한다는 것이다.  3. 2진법, 8진법, 16진법bin(), oct(), hex() 함수를 이용하면 정수형 자료를 2진법, 8진법, 16진법으로 표현된 문자열을 리턴해 줍니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bin(15)&#39;0b1111&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; oct(23)&#39;0o27&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hex(13)&#39;0xd&#39;앞의 표기법을 제외한 값만을 얻고 싶을 때는 문자열 슬라이싱을 이용하면 됩니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bin(15)[2:]1111&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; oct(23)[2:]27반대로 2, 8, 16진법으로 표기된 숫자를 10진법으로 바꾸고 싶을 때는 다음과 같은 방법을 이용할 수 있습니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; int(bin(15), 2)15&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; int(oct(23), 8)232, 8, 16진법으로 표기된 숫자를 사칙연산 하는 방법으로는 10진법으로 변환하여 사칙연산을 한 뒤 다시 해당하는 진법으로 변환합니다.bin(int(bin(15), 2) + int(oct(23), 8)) # 0b1111 + 0o27 을 계산하여 bin() 으로 감싸 결과를 2진법으로 변환한다4. 부동 소수점 연산 오류1부터 10까지 정수는 10개지만 실수는 무한히 많습니다.컴퓨터에서는 숫자를 비트로 표현하는데 실수는 유한개의 비트로 정확하게 표현할 수가 없습니다.따라서 실수는 유한개의 비트를 사용하여 근삿값으로 표현합니다.파이썬에서 0.1 + 0.2의 값은 0.3이 나올 것 같지만 실제로는 0.30000000000000004가 나옵니다.두 실수가 같은지 판단할 때는 ==을 사용하면 안 됩니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3FalsePython 3.5 이상부터 math.isclose() 함수를 사용하여 두 실수가 같은지 확인할 수 있습니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;import math&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)True5. 숫자 자료형 관련 메소드dir() 내장 함수를 이용하면 해당 객체가 갖고 있는 변수와 메소드를 보여줍니다.(익숙하지 않은 객체를 사용해야할 경우 먼저 dir() 내장 함수를 통해 변수와, 메소드를 살펴볼 수 있어 굉장히 유용합니다.)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dir(a)[&#39;__abs__&#39;, &#39;__add__&#39;, &#39;__and__&#39;, &#39;__bool__&#39;, &#39;__ceil__&#39;, &#39;__class__&#39;, &#39;__delattr__&#39;, &#39;__dir__&#39;, &#39;__divmod__&#39;, &#39;__doc__&#39;,  &#39;__eq__&#39;, &#39;__float__&#39;,   &#39;__floor__&#39;, &#39;__floordiv__&#39;, &#39;__format__&#39;, &#39;__ge__&#39;, &#39;__getattribute__&#39;, &#39;__getnewargs__&#39;, &#39;__gt__&#39;, &#39;__hash__&#39;, &#39;__index__&#39;, &#39;__init__&#39;,   &#39;__init_subclass__&#39;, &#39;__int__&#39;, &#39;__invert__&#39;, &#39;__le__&#39;, &#39;__lshift__&#39;, &#39;__lt__&#39;, &#39;__mod__&#39;, &#39;__mul__&#39;, &#39;__ne__&#39;, &#39;__neg__&#39;, &#39;__new__&#39;, &#39;__or__&#39;,   &#39;__pos__&#39;,  &#39;__pow__&#39;, &#39;__radd__&#39;, &#39;__rand__&#39;, &#39;__rdivmod__&#39;, &#39;__reduce__&#39;, &#39;__reduce_ex__&#39;, &#39;__repr__&#39;, &#39;__rfloordiv__&#39;, &#39;__rlshift__&#39;, &#39;__rmod__&#39;,   &#39;__rmul__&#39;, &#39;__ror__&#39;, &#39;__round__&#39;, &#39;__rpow__&#39;, &#39;__rrshift__&#39;, &#39;__rshift__&#39;, &#39;__rsub__&#39;, &#39;__rtruediv__&#39;, &#39;__rxor__&#39;, &#39;__setattr__&#39;, &#39;__sizeof__&#39;,   &#39;__str__&#39;, &#39;__sub__&#39;, &#39;__subclasshook__&#39;, &#39;__truediv__&#39;, &#39;__trunc__&#39;, &#39;__xor__&#39;, &#39;bit_length&#39;, &#39;conjugate&#39;, &#39;denominator&#39;, &#39;from_bytes&#39;, &#39;imag&#39;,   &#39;numerator&#39;, &#39;real&#39;, &#39;to_bytes&#39;]이 중에 double undermethod ( ex). __abs__)를 제외한 속성에 유의해서 살펴보면 됩니다.예를 들어 bit_length 메소드의 경우 객체의 비트 길이를 리턴해줍니다.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 11&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a.bit_length()4",

      "content"  : "파이썬 데이터는 객체다컴퓨터 메모리를 일련의 긴 선반으로 생각할 수 있습니다. 해 당 메모리 선반 중 각 슬롯은 폭이 1바이트 입니다. 파이썬 프로그램은 운영체제에서 컴퓨터의 일부 메모리에 접근할 수 있습니다. 이 메모리는 프로그램 자체의 코드와 데이터를 위해 사용될 수 있습니다. 파이썬은 값을 직접 처리하는 대신, 메모리에 객체로 래핑합니다.타입            이름      타입      가변                  불리언      bool      불변              정수      int      불변              부동소수점      float      불변              복소수      complex      불변              문자열      str      불변              튜플      tuple      불변              바이트      bytes      불변              프로즌 셋      frozenset      불변              리스트      list      가변              바이트 배열      bytearray      가변              셋      set      가변              딕셔너리      dict      가변      가변성값을 변경할 수 있는 경우를 가변성이라고 합니다. 그러나 파이썬은 강타입 언어이기 때문에 타입을 변경할 수는 없습니다. 즉 객체가 가변성인 경우 값은 변경 가능하지만, 타입은 변경할 수 없습니다. (타입 변경을 하면 무조건 새로운 메모리에 객체가 새로 생성된다는 얘기입니다)참조변수에 값을 할당할 때 알아야 할 중요한 사실은 할당은 값을 복사하는 것이 아니라, 단지 객체에 이름을 붙이는 것입니다. 이를 변수를 통해 객체를 참조한다라고 합니다. 또 한가지 중요한 사실은 왼쪽 그림에서 b가 참조하고 있던 값을 변경하면 정수는 불변 객체이기 때문에 새로운 값이 메모리에 생성되고 b는 새로운 값을 참조하지만,오른쪽 그림과 같이 가변 객체는 말 그대로 값을 변경할 수 있기 때문에 자신이 참조하고 있던 값을 변경해도 새로운 메모리에 값이 생성되는 것이 아니라 데이터 값을 그 자리에서 바꾸게 됩니다.그럼 만약 불변 객체는 값을 바꿀 때 마다 메모리에 새로운 데이터를 생성하게 되는데 그러면 메모리가 엄청 낭비되지 않을까 라는 생각을 할 수 있습니다. 이를 해결해 주기 위해 파이썬에는 가비지 컬렉터가 있고 이는 더 이상 참조되지 않는 객체를 메모리에서 삭제될 수 있도록 도와줍니다.복사변수의 대입을 통한 복사immutable한 객체인 숫자, 부울, 문자열, 튜플 등의 경우에는 변수의 대입을 통해 복사가 가능합니다.하지만 다음과 같이 mutable한 객체의 경우에는 복사가 안되고 값이 같이 변경되게 됩니다.얕은 복사또 하나의 가능한 복사 방법은 얕은 복사입니다. 얕은 복사는 mmutable한 객체에 대해서도 복사가 됩니다. 하지만 이 또한 문제가 발생하는 경우가 있습니다.  예를 들어 리스트와 같은 가변 객체 안에 또 가변 객체가 있게 되고 그 원소를 수정하려고 하면 진짜 복사가 아니었던 것이 드러나게 됩니다. 밑에 그림을 보게 되면  가변 객체 안에 있는 가변 객체 원소를 수정하게 되면 새로운 메모리에 할당하지 않고 그냥 바꾸기 때문에 가만히 있던 변수까지 참조하고 있는 객체의 값이 덩달아 바뀌게 됩니다.깊은 복사따라서 이러한 경우에 필요한 것이 바로 깊은 복사입니다.",
